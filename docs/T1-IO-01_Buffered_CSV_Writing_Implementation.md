# T1-IO-01: Buffered CSV Writing — Implementation Report

Date: 2025-09-30
Status: ✅ Complete
Priority: P0

## Summary
CSV export now writes through a 64 KB `BufWriter`, reducing syscalls and improving throughput while preserving exact output.

## Changes
- File: src/export/csv_export.rs
- `export_to_csv` now creates `File` then wraps in `BufWriter::with_capacity(64 * 1024)` and constructs `csv::Writer` via `from_writer`.
- Helper fns `write_headers` and `write_pair` made generic over any `Write` (`Writer<W>`), no behavior change.

## Validation
- cargo test: 32/32 passed
- cargo build --release: success
- Output format unchanged; thresholds and filtering preserved

## Expected Impact
- 30–50% faster CSV export on large result sets
- No change to bytes written, only fewer flushes/syscalls

## Next
- Proceed with T1-CONC-01 (Rayon tuning)
