# T1-CPU-03: Eliminate Redundant Normalization — Implementation Report

Date: 2025-09-30
Status: ✅ Already Implemented (no-code change)
Priority: P0

## Summary
The codebase already implements the intended optimization: per-person normalization and phonetic encoding is cached once, then reused across pairwise comparisons. No changes were required; we validated usage and tests.

## Evidence in Code
- FuzzyCache stores normalized strings and phonetic codes:
  - simple_full, simple_first, simple_mid, simple_last
  - phonetic_full, dmeta_code
- build_cache_from_person() pre-computes all of the above once per Person
- classify_pair_cached() uses the cached fields for Levenshtein/Jaro-Winkler and metaphone equality checks
- GPU fuzzy pipeline constructs Vec<FuzzyCache> for both tables and reuses it in CPU post-processing

## Locations
- src/matching/mod.rs:1268–1297 (FuzzyCache, build_cache_from_person)
- src/matching/mod.rs:1300–1315 (classify_pair_cached)
- src/matching/mod.rs:1798–1799 (cache construction for both tables)

## Validation
- cargo test: 32/32 passed
- cargo build --release: success
- Confirms no further work required for this optimization

## Expected Impact
- Reduces normalization/phonetic recomputation from O(N×M) to O(N+M)
- Eliminates redundant normalize_for_phonetic and metaphone computations during classification

## Next
- Proceed to T1-DB-01 (Batch INSERT) — already implemented in benchmark seeder via QueryBuilder multi-values with batch size 1000
- Proceed to T1-DB-02 (Connection Pool Warm-up) — implemented now
- Proceed to T1-IO-01 (Buffered CSV Writing) — implemented now for main export path
- Proceed to T1-CONC-01 (Rayon Thread Pool Tuning) — implemented now
