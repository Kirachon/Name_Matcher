## What’s improved in Name Matcher

We’ve made name matching more reliable, especially for names with accents and characters from different languages.

What changed in simple terms:
- Prevented rare crashes when a name contained unusual characters (for example, symbols or non‑Latin letters). The app now handles these safely.
- Improved handling of accented letters (like José, Müller). These are recognized more accurately during matching.
- No changes to your workflow — everything works the same, just more robust.

Why this matters:
- Fewer failures during large matching runs — better stability and fewer interruptions.
- Better match quality for international data — reduces missed matches caused by accents or special characters.
- Safer processing — the system guards against edge cases so matching completes as expected.

Notes:
- This change focuses on improving reliability for phonetic matching in English‑like names, while keeping general fuzzy matching for all languages.
- There are no changes to exports or file formats.
